Naming Players With Matching
  When picking a set, the name of a player may be the shortest unique
  abbreviation, or longer with the same root. When a previously used name could
  be considered an abbreviation/root, the previously used name is overwritten.
    Mew, and MewTwo are not valid players because Mew is an abbreviation/root
    for MewTwo. Regardless of which is used first, Mew will become MewTwo.
    MewTwo and Two are valid players. Their roots/abbreviations don't conflict.

  Option names may be shorter unique abbreviations of the full names shown above
  Full or abbreviated options may be preceded by one - or two -- dashes

Option names may be the shortest unique abbreviation of the full names
  shown above

Full or abbreviated options may be preceded by one - or two -- dashes

Naming Players
  When picking a set, the name of a player may be the shortest unique
  abbreviation. When a previously used name could be considered an
  abbreviation, the previously used name is overwritten.
  I.E. :  Mew, and MewTwo are not valid players because Mew is an abbreviation
  for MewTwo. Regardless of which is used first, Mew will become MewTwo.
  MewTwo and Two are valid players. Their roots/abbreviations don't conflict.

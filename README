JediSet is a small project under the GPL v3+ license.

Run: perl jediset.pl

It displays games of set using ascii art directly in the terminal.
Set is a game of visual pattern matching. Each card has 4 variables and 3 values for each. Be the first to find a set of 3 cards where each variable across all 3 cards is the same or different throughout.

Variables: Shape    Fill Color Number
Values:    Triangle @    pink  1
           Oval     +    yello 2
           Rect     `    green 3

This is the game being run:

..___.. ..___.. ._____. ._____. ..___.. ..___.. ._____. ..___.. ._____. ..._... ..___.. ..._... 
./@@@\. ./+++\. |`````| |@@@@@| ./+++\. ./```\. |+++++| ./```\. |@@@@@| ../@\.. ./@@@\. ../+\.. 
(@@@@@) (+++++) |`````| |@@@@@| (+++++) (`````) |+++++| (`````) |@@@@@| ./@@@\. (@@@@@) ./+++\. 
.\@@@/. .\+++/. |`````| |@@@@@| .\+++/. .\```/. |+++++| .\```/. |@@@@@| /@@@@@\ .\@@@/. /+++++\ 
..---.. ..---.. ------- ------- ..---.. ..---.. ------- ..---.. ------- ------- ..---.. -------

Note: The variable of number (multiple shapes on a card) is missing from this example output as it has yet to be implemented. Color is also missing simply because this plain text document doesn't support colored text.

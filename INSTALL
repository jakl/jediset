This program requires perl and the following perl libraries which
should come with perl:
  Getopt::Long, Term::ANSIColor, List::Util

Assuming you have perl but not the above libraries, run:
	cpan Getopt::Long
	cpan Term::ANSIColor
	cpan List::Util

Run these commands to install jediset:
	cd /usr/local/bin
	sudo ln -s /path/to/jediset.pl jediset
	sudo chmod +x jediset


So your running Windows instead of Linux?

Install msysGit-netinstall from this site
http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list

It should install to your C drive under a folder called msysgit
Go into that folder and run msys.bat

The first time you run msys.bat, you have to type:
git clone git://github.com/jediknight304/jediset.git

For now and all future times, type this before playing or updating:
cd jediset

To play, type:
./jediset.pl

To update, type:
git pull


If I were you I'd make a shortcut to msys.bat on your desktop
